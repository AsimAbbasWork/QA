Developer to start work on new Feature_1 Branch:
git clone $Reposiroty_url.git (get complete repository from remote location to local machine)
git switch develop (switch current branch to develop branch)
git checkout -b $Branch_name (D+ :create new branch with desired name based off of current develop branch)
git fetch --all --prune (update all branches on local machine with code on remote branches)
git add --all (D+Feature_1 : add all code in current feature branch to be pushed to remote)
git commit -m "add code for Feature_1 branch" (add a commit message)
git status (check if there are any files not added to stage for pushing to remote)
git pull (D + Feature_1 +E merge current state of develop branch INTO feature branch)
git push (push current feature branch to remote feature branch)

Developer will create pull request to merge feature branch into develop
Git admin will merge the feature branch code into develop after the feature branch tests have passed
Git admin will finally merge the develop branch into master after all regression tests have passed at end of sprint
